            <h1 id="firsth1">Kentucky Woman</h1>
                <p>Audrey Gray Owens Sanner was born on May 12, 1926 in Middlesboro, Kentucky. She grew up surrounded by the beautiful hills of what has been discovered to be a meteor crater. Home to the famous path that Daniel Boone cut between the mountains to lead the settlers west, the area is full of Smokey Mountain beauty and rich history. Perhaps it was the rich smell of the humid air that lended itself to a sense of constant nostalgia for Audrey. These mountains kept memories and secrets. Audrey grew up running over these hills and splashing in the creeks, enjoying a large, extended family that stretched around Kentucky and Tennessee. Audrey grew to love the mountains and learned to keep her own memories and secrets. Now, she tells them in a new memoir, <em>Kentucky Woman</em>, due to be in-print in 2017.</p>

            <p>Audrey Owens met Jim Sanner, originally from Mount Zion, Illinois, when she was just a freshman at the University of Kentucky. He "helped" her with her homework, making up funny definitions for the words she was looking up. A short three months later, they were in love, but he was shipping out for camp and then overseas to fight the Germans. Because of this, most of their courtship was recorded in the letters they sent each other back and forth which, of course, Audrey has kept safe for more than 70 years. In the letters, Audrey detailed her life at home and wrote of her classes. Jim wrote of the goings-on at camp, his inability to procure a razor, and eventually of the battle where he was wounded. Audrey recorded these letters in a book, <em>Dear, Audrey: Love, Jim</em>.</p>

                <h1>Family Tree</h1>
                <p>Audrey has dedicated much of her adult life to the research and preservation of family history. Thanks to her efforts, we can trace the family tree back for generations. We don't just know names; we know stories. Like the time our ancestor, an Irish lord, was about to get his head chopped off, so he dressed as a woman and escaped to England. Or how about the time that a large branch of the family was leaving for America and accidentally left the baby on the doc in Ireland with the maid? (He was fine, but he never made it to America, and was raised by an older brother.) Then there's the fact that we are related to the Brothers Grimm. Which might be precisely why so many of us in this family are so rivetted by the stories Audrey has uncovered and remembered from her own life. </p>
                <p>Eliza Greer Cadle Owens' family's tree could go on for quite some time; she had <em>fourteen</em> children. She lived an amazing life full of family dinners noisy with her large extended family. Audrey describes Sunday dinners that occurred at the old homestead where her grandma Eliza and grandpa Robert Owens lived: "It was a large table. The chairs were very old cane-bottom chairs that Grandpa had made or gotten years ago and had seen a lot of use. There was also a bench. The men always ate first, then the women and then the children were called inside. We always hoped something would be left. However, Mother had usually handed out the back door to James and me a biscuit with a piece of ham or chicken so the waiting wasn’t too bad. She always gave James the chicken liver. When James and Edna [Audey's brother and sister-in-law] were first married and we took her over there for the first time, she was offended when told she couldn’t eat until the men had finished. But that’s the way it was.</p>
                <p>Here is a brief example of some of the information she has recorded.</p>
